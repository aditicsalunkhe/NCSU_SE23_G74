### Project 5
#### Project title - FeatureHunt 
#### Project link - https://github.com/elric97/feature-hunt  
#### Project description - FeatureHunt is a web-based collaboration platform for product design ideas creation and discussion. Current version includes important features such as user registration, user login process, idea thread creation, info search, up voting, comment system and so on. This project is phthon/JS based and involves a standard system architecture of front end, back end and database. The project repo has basic open source structures such as source files, testing framework, contributor policies, user documents and developer documents.  
#### Project evaluation summary: 1. It comforms to basic open source software engineering development standards and best practices, but there are still many places needed to be imporved, such as a quick-start guide to developer contributor, a more compresive class/code documentation, a elegate GIF instead of a video link as the promotion content and development roadmap 2. The application has the basic functions as a message sharing and discussion platform. However, there are no killer features which can capture users attention among all other similiar applications. If choosing this project as the base for future work, our group could identify one or two key features and design and implement them in a more deeper, solid and creative way
#### Score: 56/90

## Part 3 - Essay
1.	What was hard about this process?  <br />
Trying to understand precisely about projects from other developers is hard. From technical aspects, we need firstly check its technology stacks to look which programming languages, frameworks and system architectures it employs. For example, during our experimenting with one project, we find there're two imported Python packages that we're not familiar with and imported them together could produce an error. Another problem is that our chosen project lacks enough documentations such as a class/function documentation which help other developers know how to code from a low level. Without this, it's highly possible that we would misuse existing classes and functions when developing on top of it. From system views, it's also painful to try to know the layout and meaning of directories and files in Github repository without a well-defined documentation as well as how to run the project correctly. For instance, although the documentation included installation and execution instructions for these projects, we encountered numerous errors while attempting to follow them. Both projects utilize Python for the server-side and Node.js for client-side scripting. All the necessary dependencies were outlined in the requirements.txt and package.json files. While there were no errors installing the Python dependencies using requirements.txt, we had to use the --force command to install the Node.js dependencies, indicating potential dependency conflicts or errors. Besides from that, the project lacks documentations talks about how to contributing to the project, and there seems to have no communication channels for later developers to quick connect with the original developers. It will be very risky to estimate the usage of existing classes and functions, and even fatal to write new classes and functions on top of that.

2.	How the pain could have been avoided? <br />
For unfamiliar technical frameworks and programming languages, we could learn in advance before formally starting the development, from different sources such as Udemy, Youtube Channel, quick start documentations from official websites and so on.
For lacking documentations, developers should have the mindset of setting it up on day one. It will be too late to write them at the time when coding has been completed for reasons that developers may have forgotten about the implementation details or lack enough motivation to do that. In addition, we should keep in mind to write a comprehensive documentation including three or even four sub-documentation. The first one should be the readme.md file which will usually serves as the first impression of the project. It should cover almost all aspects of this project in a concise way with limited words. After all, a good readme.md file will introduce the project to those who show some interests in a smooth and welcoming manner without giving much understanding burden. The second part should be a well-defined system-level documentation. It should tell people in an all-round way about the design aspects, implementation stages and testing processes by a detailed instruction. This document should be the main reference point for most developers to begin serious jobs on this project. The third one should be the class/function documentation which could illustrate the basic coding elements in the project. These one should be written in a standard format with short descriptions, required parameters and return values so that other developers could expand the code base in a confident way, without writing unnecessary bugs and unintended side functions. The last but not the least, there should exist a quick guide documentation so that by referencing it, people can make the project running and test basic functions in a few minutes with almost no overhead.

3.	What practices you are committing to perform in project2 to avoid that pain? <br />
-	Write comprehensive documentations. Here, for the definition of “comprehensive”, we don't mean it should be a one hundred pages PDF file containing everything in detail. Rather, as our project will be a small one featuring not too many functions and may serve as a base for later student developers, our group will focus more efforts on writing a knowledgeable but concise Readme.md file and a class/function document covering all the codebase.
- Test early and test often. Though our coding scope will not be millions of lines like a real-world application deployed for hundreds of thousands of users, we should always stick to this coding philosophy because testing can help developers avoid unnecessary bugs and improve projects' code quality. More importantly, it could help us identify and debug problems at relative early stage which may evolve to development disaster in later stages if not testing well.
- Agile development. Since our project would be a small one with countable features which are not hard to design and implement, with deadline limited to end of this semester, we would use Scrum to guide development process. We will try best to deliver one important feature in one week or two. We will also hold regular meeting where group members could talk about what they've completed since last meeting, what's their plan for next week and what resources they need in order to address the problems encountered.
- Dockerization. We aim to maximize Docker utilization to mitigate dependency conflicts and offer setup references for various technologies, enhancing the overall user experiences.
