### Project 5
#### Project title - FeatureHunt 
#### Project link - https://github.com/elric97/feature-hunt  
#### Project description - FeatureHunt is a web-based collaboration platform for product design ideas creation and discussion. Current version includes important features such as user registration, user login process, idea thread creation, info search, up voting, comment system and so on. This project is phthon/JS based and involves a standard system architecture of front end, back end and database. The project repo has basic open source structures such as source files, testing framework, contributor policies, user documents and developer documents.  
#### Project evaluation summary: 1. It comforms to basic open source software engineering development standards and best practices, but there are still many places needed to be imporved, such as a quick-start guide to developer contributor, a more compresive class/code documentation, a elegate GIF instead of a video link as the promotion content and development roadmap 2. The application has the basic functions as a message sharing and discussion platform. However, there are no killer features which can capture users attention among all other similiar applications. If choosing this project as the base for future work, our group could identify one or two key features and design and implement them in a more deeper, solid and creative way
#### Score: 56/90
